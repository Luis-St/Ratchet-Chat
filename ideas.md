# Ideas for future feature implementations

## Group Chats

## Built in TURN server for improved calls

## Improved Call Settings (quality, ...)

## Privacy features

Like (blocking, message requests, visibility of account to outside)
Or blocking a whole ratchet server (@...)
Blocking calls from unknowns

## Customization (themes, profile picture)

## Transferring account to another ratchet server

## Collaborative encrypted boundless canvas in chat

## Gif picker

## Stickers

## Multi File upload (extended file limits)

## Secure Push Notifications

## Account mirroring to other servers (message backup style)

## Native app (?)

## work out a proper versioning system

## Account recovery procedure if lost access to passkeys (proof with master password?)

## Master password changing ability

## master password reset if forgot/lost (only through valid passkey session, deletes/resets ALL encrypted data)
