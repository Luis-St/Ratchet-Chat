Blocking calls from unknowns

## Customization (themes, profile picture)

## Transferring account to another ratchet server

## Collaborative encrypted boundless canvas in chat

## Gif picker

## Stickers

## Multi File upload (extended file limits)

## Secure Push Notifications

## Account mirroring to other servers (message backup style)

## Native app (?)
